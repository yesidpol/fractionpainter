## Getting started

Let's paint $\frac{10}{3}$ üé®üñåÔ∏è

1. Download [fractionpainter.js file](./fractionpainter.js) and include in your code
   
   ```html
   <script src="fractionpainter.js"></script>
   ```

2. Add the element where you want the fraction appear: a div or a span
   
   ```html
   <div id="fraction_container1"></div>
   ```

3. Call the `paint` method of the `fractionPainter` object: this takes the element [selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) as the first argument and the [options](#options) as the second argument.

   ```javascript
    fractionPainter.paint("#fraction_container1", {width: 800, height: 450, numerator: 10, denominator: 3});
   ```

and that's all (see [example.html](./example.html)):
